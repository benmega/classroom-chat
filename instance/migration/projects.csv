I am impressed with his loop to spawn 55 skeletons and his organization of his games into functions. He also uses variables well in order to modify the properties of the game objects.	While his code is very well organized, I would like to see a bit of improvement in the game balancing. We did a bit of this during his presentation by reducing player.maxSpeed a bit, but I think he could make his game even more by adjusting the difficulty even more. This can take a bit of testing but the result will be an amazing game that is neither too easy nor too hard.","

While the game itself is not too difficult due to the player's extremely high attack damage, health, and speed; it is still very fun. I am especially impressed with his choice to build a custom maze with a collection of forest objects instead of simply using game.spawnMaze. Eventually, we will discuss ways to clean up this code a bit with arrays but, for now, this is a good method. He also shows a good understanding of object properties ""“ most notably with the generator spawn delays.

This greatly increases modularity and allowed him to create a game that can easily be built upon. The game loop works well but the game does get a bit tedious after a bit. I would recommend reducing the boss's health a bit and adding a boss turn so the players take damage as well. This will prevent the number of rounds needed to win and adding in a risk of losing will increase tension.

I especially enjoyed the creative ways the game ends when the user enters an unhandled input. To make the story even better, I'd suggest expanding the part about the ""weird-looking woman"" and making her a bigger part of the adventure.","

36,Text-Based Adventure,In this project students create a text-based adventure game where players navigate through different scenarios solving puzzles and making choices that affect the outcome. The game introduces basic coding concepts such as variables loops and conditionals. It offers an interactive and engaging way to learn programming while creating a fun story-driven experience.,,35,"Pluem discovered the potential of generative AI during this project, and it clearly added some fun elements to the game! However, relying heavily on AI-generated code made it a bit challenging for him to fully understand and enhance it later on. Using tools like ChatGPT can be great for your own projects, but I recommend asking it to simplify or explain the code as you go. This way, you'll be able to read, understand, and build upon it, rather than ending up with a generic game that's hard to improve.","

39,Text-Based Adventure,In this project students create a text-based adventure game where players navigate through different scenarios solving puzzles and making choices that affect the outcome. The game introduces basic coding concepts such as variables loops and conditionals. It offers an interactive and engaging way to learn programming while creating a fun story-driven experience.,,46,"Congratulations to Vin for having his code voted the best text adventure! His story is engaging and imaginative, truly capturing the players' interest. I'm pleased to see his consistent use of variables and conditional statements, which demonstrates a solid grasp of the concepts we've covered so far. I'm also impressed with his thoughtful use of ChatGPT to assist with his code, rather than simply copying the generated responses.","

The project emphasizes applying the Engineering Design Process: defining the problem designing a solution building the simulation revising based on user feedback and reflecting on the process. Students are encouraged to use tools and resources including randomization or other functions to create dynamic simulations. Peer collaboration is key as students will test each other’s simulations and provide constructive feedback to improve the final project.,,108,"Congrats on your first GitHub repo, Eugene! You built five interactive simulations, including coin flips, ball throws, the ""butter side down"" bread fall, a playful system overload, and the Monty Hall puzzle. These projects showcase real algorithmic thinking and the ability to create modular code. Your work demonstrates creativity, problem-solving, and confidence with basic functions, randomization, and program logic.

Randomization (game.randomInt(18)) also keeps the gameplay surprising and fun. In the future, we will learn to use lists to avoid repetitive if-statements, but this is a fine solution for now.
