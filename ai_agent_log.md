### ASSISTANT
To solve the issue of showing nicknames and displaying a message about the quantity and type of duck claimed, we need to make a few changes. We'll modify the `pending_trades.html` template file to show the nicknames and provide a descriptive message about the ducks. Additionally, we might need a helper function to format the duck information.

### Steps:
1. **Modify `pending_trades.html`:** Adjust the template to include the nickname and display the descriptive message.
2. **Update `duck_trade_routes.py`:** If necessary, add any business logic required to format the trade description.
3. **Test these changes** to ensure they are reflected correctly.

Here's how the changes would look:

### Step 1: Update `pending_trades.html`
- Add a field to display nicknames (assuming `nickname` is available from the backend).
- Construct a string that details the quantity and type of ducks claimed.

```html
{% extends 'admin/admin_base.html' %}

{% block content %}
<h2>Pending Trades</h2>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>User</th>
        <th>Nickname</th> <!-- Added Nickname column -->
        <th>Trade Details</th> <!-- Column for detailed trade description -->
        <th>Action</th>
    </tr>
    {% for trade in trades %}
    <tr id="trade-row-{{ trade.id }}">
        <td>{{ trade.username }}</td>
        <td>{{ trade.nickname }}</td> <!-- Displaying nickname -->
        <td>{{ trade.get_trade_description() }}</td> <!-- Placeholder for trade description -->
        <td>
            <button class="trade-action" data-trade-id="{{ trade.id }}" value="approve">Approve</button>
            <button class="trade-action" data-trade-id="{{ trade.id }}" value="reject">Reject</button>
        </td>
    </tr>
    {% endfor %}
</table>
{% endblock %}
```

### Step 2: Format Trade Details in `duck_trade.py`
To make this work, we'll add a method in `DuckTradeLog` model to format the trade description:

```python
class DuckTradeLog(db.Model):
    # existing fields

    # Method to create a trade description
    def get_trade_description(self):
        bit_count = len(self.bit_ducks)
        byte_count = len(self.byte_ducks)
        return f"{self.digital_ducks} Digital Ducks, {bit_count} Bit-Ducks and {byte_count} Byte-Ducks."
```

### Step 3: Writing Changes Back
Let's implement the required modifications in the `pending_trades.html` and `duck_trade.py` files.

### ASSISTANT
The changes have been successfully implemented and all tests have passed. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

1. **Pending Trades Template (`pending_trades.html`):**
   - Added a column to display nicknames.
   - Included a column that shows a formatted string with the quantity and type of ducks claimed in each trade.

2. **Duck Trade Model (`duck_trade.py`):**
   - Added a `nickname` field to represent user nicknames.
   - Implemented the `get_trade_description()` method within the `DuckTradeLog` class to create a descriptive message about the ducks in a trade.

These updates enhance the visibility of trade details for pending trades by showing both user nicknames and a descriptive message of the trade contents. All modifications are functioning correctly, as evidenced by the successful test run. If you have any further requests or need additional features, feel free to ask!
