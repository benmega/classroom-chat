### ASSISTANT
The issue with the "edit-pic-btn" styling has been resolved by updating the CSS to ensure the button is now styled as an overlay on the profile image, providing a more professional appearance. The updated styles include positioning the button at the bottom-right corner of the profile image, creating a visually appealing overlay effect when hovered over.

All tests have passed successfully, indicating that the changes have not introduced any issues. The enhancements are now complete.
